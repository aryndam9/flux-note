# Audio Recorder Prompt

I want to create an Electron.js app that captures audio output and microphone input, performs on-device speech-to-text using Whisper, and summarizes the transcription using the OpenAI ChatGPT API. Here are the steps I would like to follow:

1. Set up an Electron.js project with a modern UI interface using Material-UI.
2. Implement functionality to select the device speaker audio and microphone input sources.
3. Record the selected audio sources and provide a way to play back the recordings for debugging purposes.
4. Integrate the Whisper library to perform on-device speech-to-text on the recorded audio.
5. Send the transcription to the OpenAI ChatGPT API for summarization.
6. Display the summarized output in the Electron.js app.

For each step, please provide the necessary code changes, folder structure, libraries to install, and any additional guidance or best practices.
